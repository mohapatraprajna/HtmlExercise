<p align="justify">Java is a general-purpose computer-programming language that is concurrent, class-based, object-oriented,<br>
and specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.<br>
It is intended to let application developers "write once, run anywhere" <br>
(WORA)meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.<br>
Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of computer architecture</p>
